# Open Hazards PH

### What is the license of the data?
We respect the license of the original source, each data source and data files have a corresponding license file. License varies from different agencies, in most cases government data are public domain.

### Most data archived here are available in other government websites, why do this?
Philippine government data policy changes from the tenure of an administration to another, we want to ensure
that what was public will remain public even if projects ran out of funds or there is a change in access policy.

### I found some cool hazards data, will you host it?
Yes! Please open a ticket on the [open-hazards-ph repo](https://github.com/maning/open-hazards-ph) and let's discuss.
